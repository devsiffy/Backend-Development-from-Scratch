=====================
Day 05 - Mega Project
=====================

This is the 1st day of our mega back-end project. We are building this project by following a real professional development process used in software companies.


Project Design
--------------

    → First, the design team creates the project screens (pages) using tools like Figma or any other design tool.

    → The designers give us all the screens. These screens help us to understand how the website or app will look.


Database Planning
-----------------

    → After getting the design, we start working on the database.

    → We collect the required data and plan how to store and manage it.

    → We create a data modeling diagram. This shows how the data will be structured and connected.

    → In this project, the data model diagram is created using an online tool called Eraser.io.


Create Project Folder
---------------------

    → Now, we create a folder for our project.

    → Inside the folder, we start a new Node.js project using this command:

        npm init

    → This will create a file called package.json


Create Standard File and Folder Structure
-----------------------------------------

    → We create the following folders and files. This is a common structure used by many companies:

        public
        public/temp
        src
        src/controllers
        src/routes
        src/utils
        src/db
        src/models
        src/middlewares

        src/index.js
        src/constants.js
        src/app.js
        .env
        .gitignore
        .prettierrc
        .prettierignore
        README.md


Install Development Tools
-------------------------

    → We install some tools that help developers while coding.

    → To automatically restart the server when files are changed:

        npm i -D nodemon

    → To keep code formatting the same for all team members:

        npm i -D prettier


Setup .gitignore File
---------------------

    → The .gitignore file tells Git which files or folders to ignore.

    → We use this online tool to generate a .gitignore file for Node.js projects:

        https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore


Configure Prettier
------------------

    → We create and configure two files:

        .prettierrc          → for prettier rules
        .prettierignore      → for files to ignore by prettier


Edit package.json
-----------------

    → In the package.json file, we update two things:

        * Set the module type to use ES modules (if needed)
        * Add some custom scripts like starting the server


Quick Tips
----------

    → First, understand the design and how the app will look.
    → Plan your database properly before writing any code.
    → Follow a clean and professional folder structure.
    → Use tools like nodemon and prettier to make development easier.
    → Use .gitignore to avoid pushing unwanted files to GitHub.
    → Prettier helps keep your code clean and the same for all developers.
    → Always update your package.json carefully.
