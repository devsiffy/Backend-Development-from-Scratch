=====================
Day 09 - Mega Project
=====================

This is the 5th day of our mega back-end project. We are building this project by following a real professional development process used in software companies.


CLOUDINARY SETUP
----------------

We are using Cloudinary to store images and other files in the cloud.

Steps we followed:
    * Create a free Cloudinary account  
    * Add Cloudinary credentials in `.env` file:
        → CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME  
        → CLOUDINARY_API_KEY  
        → CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET  

    * Installed Cloudinary npm package  
    * Created `src/utils/cloudinary.js`  
        → Configure Cloudinary using credentials from `.env`  
        → Added a function `uploadOnCloudinary` to upload files from local to Cloudinary  
        → Handles errors and deletes local file if upload fails  

Important points:
    → Cloudinary stores files safely and allows easy access via URLs  
    → Always keep API keys secret in `.env`  
    → Handle upload errors properly to avoid broken files  


MULTER SETUP
------------

We are using Multer to handle file uploads from clients to our server.

Steps we followed:
    * Installed Multer npm package  
    * Created `src/middleware/multer.middleware.js`  
        → Configure storage folder (`./public/temp`)  
        → Configure file naming  
        → Export middleware to use in routes  

Important points:
    → Multer helps store files temporarily on server before uploading to Cloudinary  
    → Works together with Cloudinary for full upload workflow  
    → Middleware makes it easy to add file upload in specific routes

QUICK TIPS
----------

    → Keep API keys secret in `.env` file  
    → Always handle errors during file upload  
    → Use temporary folder for files before sending to cloud  
    → Combine Multer + Cloudinary for full upload workflow  
    → Test file uploads with different file types (images, videos)
