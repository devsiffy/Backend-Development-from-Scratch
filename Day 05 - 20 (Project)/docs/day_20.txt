=====================
Day 20 - Mega Project
=====================

This is the 16th day of our mega back-end project. We are building this project by following a real professional development process used in software companies.


=================
Models in Backend
=================


Created More Models
-------------------

We created more models given below:
    * Comment model
    * Like model
    * Tweet model
    * Playlist model


Comment Model
-------------

Used to store comments made by users on a video.

Fields in comment model:
    → content (required text)
    → video (reference to a Video)
    → owner (reference to a User)

Uses timestamps:
    → Adds createdAt and updatedAt fields automatically.

Uses a plugin:
    → mongooseAggregatePaginate helps in pagination for large data sets.


Like Model
----------

Like model is used to store likes.

One user can like a:
    → video
    → comment
    → tweet

Fields in like model:
    → video (optional)
    → comment (optional)
    → tweet (optional)
    → likedBy (required, reference to User)

Design note:
    → Only one of video, comment, or tweet will be liked at a time.
    → But all are optional, so you must handle this logic in code.

Also uses timestamps.


Playlist Model
--------------

Used to store user playlists with multiple videos.

Fields in playlist model:
    → name (required string)
    → description (required string)
    → videos (array of Video references)
    → owner (reference to User who created it)

Good for features like:
    → Save videos in a list
    → Share playlists with others

Also uses timestamps.


Tweet Model
-----------

Used to store simple text-based posts.

Fields in tweet model:
    → content (required string)
    → owner (reference to User)

Also uses timestamps.
