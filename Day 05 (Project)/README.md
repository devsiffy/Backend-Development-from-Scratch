### IMPORTANT NOTE:-

From now, we are working on a mega project that is build by following the professional industry grade project development cycle.

We develop this project in some days, and each day's progress (work) is documented in the "/docs" folder day-wise.
And also the "Project Model Design" is given in the "/docs" folder.

```
NOTE:- I don't share my '.env' credentials, instead of I share the 'must_change.env' file in which I define all the credentials that are used in the project so first you must change its name to '.env' and add your own credential values to the credential variables required in that file..!
```
